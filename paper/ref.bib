  Abstract                 = {Many scientific and engineering applications involve inverting large matrices or solving systems of linear algebraic equations. Solving these problems with proven algorithms for direct methods can take very long to compute, as they depend on the size of the matrix. The computational complexity of the stochastic Monte Carlo methods depends only on the number of chains and the length of those chains. The computing power needed by inherently parallel Monte Carlo methods can be satisfied very efficiently by distributed computing technologies such as Grid computing. In this paper we show how a load balanced Monte Carlo method for computing the inverse of a dense matrix can be constructed, show how the method can be implemented on the Grid, and demonstrate how efficiently the method scales on multiple processors.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we introduce a new algorithm, based on the successful work of Fathi and Alexandrov, on hybrid Monte Carlo algorithms for matrix inversion and solving systems of linear algebraic equations. This algorithm consists of two parts, approximate inversion by Monte Carlo and iterative refinement using a deterministic method. Here we present a parallel hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm, which uses Monte Carlo to generate an approximate inverse and that improves the accuracy of the inverse with an iterative refinement. The new algorithm is applied efficiently to sparse non-singular matrices. When we are solving a system of linear algebraic equations, Bx = b, the inverse matrix is used to compute the solution vector x = B –1 b. We present results that show the efficiency of the parallel hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm in the case of sparse matrices. Keywords: Monte Carlo Method, Matrix Inversion, Sparse Matrices.},
